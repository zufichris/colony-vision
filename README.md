# Project: Colony Image Processing üöÄ  
**[View Solution](https://github.com/colony-vision/solution.md)**

## Task Overview  
The goal is to process **26 images** of colonies forming on dishes, delivering the required outputs with precision and consistency. This project involves basic image segmentation tasks designed to isolate and highlight individual colonies, with emphasis on maintaining the original image resolution.

## Deliverables  

### For Each Image (Total: 26 Images):  

1. **Original Image**  
   The unaltered image, exactly as provided.  

2. **Segmented Image**  
   A processed version where individual colonies are highlighted or isolated.  

3. **Combined Image**  
   A side-by-side comparison or overlay of the original and segmented images.  
   - **Note**: The combined image must match the resolution of the original.  

4. **Verification Code**  
   A unique identifier confirming the image processing is complete and meets requirements.

### Total Outputs  

- **Images**:  
  - **26 Original Images**  
  - **26 Segmented Images**  
  - **26 Combined Images**  
  - **Total**: **78 images**  

- **Resolution**:  
  - All output images must maintain the **same resolution** as the originals.  

---

## Timeline ‚è≥  

- **Deadline**:  
  - The task must be completed within **4 days**.  

---

## Notes  

- This task is described as one of the **"most basic segmentation requirements."**  
  - **Expectations**: Standard quality and accuracy for colony isolation.  
  - **Approach**: Simplicity and efficiency in segmentation algorithms.  

- Images are provided via a **Google Drive link** for immediate download.  

---

## Approach  

1. **Image Segmentation**  
   - Use adaptive thresholding and noise reduction to isolate colonies.  

2. **Image Comparison**  
   - Create a side-by-side comparison or overlay of the original and processed results.  

3. **Verification Code**  
   - Generate a unique code for each processed image, ensuring traceability.  

4. **Automation**  
   - Batch process all 26 images to meet the 4-day deadline efficiently.
